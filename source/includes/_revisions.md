# Revisions

Sometimes, after a template is completed, clients decide that they want to do a brand refresh or part of the template isn’t working for their team as expected and they want to make changes. The revision process is slightly different from the creation process.

Typical Revision Pipeline:

1. Receive template request from client.
2. Client sends example and “commented” documents that show exactly what they are looking for with this template.
   - The “commented” verison is created by exporting the current template from OpenAsset and adding textboxes or notes with comments on what changes need to be made.
   - Please include the logo file if applicable
3. Customer Success team scopes the template and submits it to the Support Team.
4. Support Team makes the expected changes in the document and/or script.
5. Support Team tests the template and let’s the client know that a draft is complete.
6. The client has 2 weeks to provide any feedback.
7. Template is approved and ready to be used.

## How we handle Logo/Brand Refreshes

Logo and brand refreshes are handled via the revision pipeline above. Logo refreshes may not require as many details and may not require a “commented” version as these are mostly a 1 to 1 replacement. Just make sure to provide the logo file. Brand refreshes typically require new styles/fonts/colors, so it’s important to provide all of the details for each item that needs to be changed.

## Costs

We have a day rate of $x/day and an [internal?] scoping document that tells our team how much time each type of update takes.
