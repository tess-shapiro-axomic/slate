# Images

One of the benefits of OpenAsset custom templates is that the images from your system will be automatically placed into the document to help ensure that all users are using the correct images and don’t need to dig through a file system to find them. It is important to note that image frames are not dynamic. This means that if you want project 1 on your template to have 4 images and project 2 to have 2 images, you will need to request 2 different templates and combine them on your own.

## Project Based Templates vs. Image Based Templates

Project-based templates are launched from the Projects page. The project object contains information about selected project and multiple projects can be selected at once. With project templates, you will not be able to manually select which images generate in the template, however you can request that images are ordered in a certain way. An example of this is requesting that images are ordered by rank. So rank 1 images will pull in first, then 2, 3, etc.

File-based (or image-based) templates are launched from the Files page. Each file has information attached to it and that information can be pulled into the template. Non-project files, like reference files, can provide the fields associated with the file. Project files can provide the file fields as well as the fields and keywords for the project the file is associated with. Some client choose to have a file-based project sheet template so that they can have more control over what images are populated, but it’s important to keep in mind that the user needs to select the correct amount of images per project sheet for this to work as expected.

With all templates, clients have the option to use drag and drop ([INDD](https://success.openasset.com/en/articles/3091555-using-the-indesign-plugin-to-create-documents) & [more](https://success.openasset.com/en/articles/3091761-dragging-files-directly-into-other-applications)) to replace any images that come through automatically.

## Capabilities of Ranking &lt;> Images and how it relates to templates

[Ranks](https://success.openasset.com/en/articles/3078582-customizing-ranks) are very useful in organizing your files in OpenAsset. For project-based templates, they can help prioritize images in order of what you want to appear in a template and what you don’t. We can do things like add logic so that no rank 5 images appear in templates or only rank 1 images.
