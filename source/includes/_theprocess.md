# The Process: What We Need

The template process starts with the client looking at documents they use regularly and their OpenAsset system in order to decide what custom templates would be useful for them.

Typical Templating Pipeline:

1. Receive template request from client.
2. Client sends example and “blank” documents that show exactly what they are looking for with this template.
   - Please include the logo file if applicable
3. Customer Success team scopes the template and submits it to the Support Team.
4. Support Team creates the base template with formatting and script labels.
5. Support Team scripts the logic on the client's OpenAsset instance.
6. Support Team tests the template and let’s the client know that a draft is complete.
7. The client has up to three rounds of revisions (two weeks to provide feedback per revision).
8. Template is approved and ready to be used.

## What we need from the client (“blank” and example)

The client must provide 2 documents for our team. The first is an example document. This document should be exactly what you expect to export from OpenAsset. Any images, fields, keywords, styles, formatting, etc. should be included here. The second document is what we call a “blank” version. This will include placeholder for your images, and field/keyword names in place of the expected metadata.

### Example document

![alt_text](images/exampleTemplate.png "Example Template")

### Blank document

![alt_text](images/blankTemplate.png "Blank Template")

## What OpenAsset is responsible for

- Scoping the template
- Creating/scripting the template
- Testing the template
- Making in-scope revisions and discussing out of scope revisions

## What the client is responsible for (expectation setting)

- Providing the example and “blank” documents
- Sharing revisions within the 2 week period
- Discussing out of scope revisions
- Approving the template

## Deciding what information is included

Any metadata directly related to the object selected is available for use on the templates e.g. project-based templates can definitely show all project fields, and all project-level keywords, and all of that project’s files.

Additionally, employee-based templates can leverage project information based on what project roles are assigned to the employee generated. If Mary Smith is assigned a project role in OpenAsset for the London Bridge project, her resume template can show fields, keywords, and the project’s hero image for that project.

Project-based templates can list the employees associated with the project and their role title on that project.

## Turnaround Timelines

Once a template request has been submitted to the Support Team’s services queue, the client should expect to see a first draft 2-3 weeks later. This timeline is subject to change depending on how many tickets are currently in the queue across all services.

After support sends the first draft, the client has 2 weeks to respond with any changes they want that are in scope. We consider requests to be in scope when they apply to the original scope of the template (fonts, styles, layout, OA fields mappings, etc.). We recommend that clients carefully review the template, note as many amendments as needed, and share screenshotsof any issues in one, cohesive request. We also recommend that the main point of contact shares this draft with any relevant team members to avoid confusion and delays.

## Overview of Revision Period

The Revision Period for template creation requests includes up to 3 rounds of revisions. The OpenAsset team will provide a first draft, then the client will have 2 weeks to review and provide any feedback. As mentioned above, revisions must be apply to the original scope of the template and we recommend that clients carefully review the template, note as many amendments as needed, and share screenshots of any issues in one, cohesive request. We also recommend that the main point of contact shares this draft with any relevant team members to avoid confusion and delays.

## How we handle bundle requests

Many clients like to provide documents for multiple templates at once. While, we want clients to be able to have as many templates as they need, we will be limiting the number of requests a client can put in at once to **2 templates**. This ensures that our team is a efficient and effective as possible. Once your two templates are completed and approved, you can submit 2 more.
