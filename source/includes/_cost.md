# Cost

[JLN to add language here about what templates cost. I know some packages have it included and we also have a daily rate, but not sure what is to be made public].

## Associated costs with templates after certain timelines

Clients who are unable to provide feedback within the allotted window may be subject to the associated costs for their revisions. We have a day rate of $x/day and an [internal?] scoping document that tells our team how much time each type of update takes.

## A note that template revisions may have associated costs

Revisions are that out of scope are also subject to additional costs. We have a day rate of $x/day and an [internal?] scoping document that tells our team how much time each type of update takes.
