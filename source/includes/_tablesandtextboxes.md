# Tables & Text Boxes

## SF330s pitfall of tables vs. cells

One of the more common custom template requests is for an SF330 form. We do have limitations that come up frequently with this type of template. In InDesign, we cannot append to tables. If you want an SF330 InDesign template, each box on the form needs to be its own textbox. In Word and Powerpoint, it can be a table, but Word and Powerpoint have their own limitations (see Limitations section).

## How we handle overflow in text boxes across templates

In InDesign, there are some limitations when requesting the a text box flow from one spread to another. This will only occur automatically for the first object generated. For any other objects after that, it will require a manual edit. [Users who download the template will need to manually click on the red + on the first text box, then click inside the second pageâ€™s text box.](https://helpx.adobe.com/ca/indesign/using/threading-text.html)
