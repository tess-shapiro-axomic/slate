# Documentation

This folder contains the documentation source for OpenAsset custom templates.

## Slate

[Slate](https://github.com/lord/slate) is a static API documentation tool. It is used to generate
HTML markup and assets from the `source` folder in this directory, on a build to staging or master.
When adding new sections, the markdown under `source/includes` should be updated, and will
then be published once merged.

This is a non-traditional use of Slate. We have hidden the column that is used for the code examples as this is inteded to be client-facing template documentation managed and maintained by the Support Engineering Team.
